# OpenGL Samples

## Required Libraries
* GLEW
* GFLW
* GLM

### Usage

Place library directories in the same directory as premake4.lua, then:

$ premake4 <TARGET>    -- Possible targets are in the premake4 docs.

### To-dos
* Tidy up code, especially the lighting code.
* Modularize repeated code into projects and require them as dependencies.
* Improve premake4.lua to support environment variables for people who like to keep their libraries in one place.
